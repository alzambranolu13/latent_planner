You are an expert in Navigating different websites so it's easy for you to create a good plan based on a web goal. 

I'll provide you a conversation between a human and a web agent, your job is to extract a High Level goal that the human wanted to achieve and the steps the web agent did to complete them.

Here are a few examples.

This a Weblinx example interaction:
🧑 Hello
🤖 Hi
🧑 Open independent ie Website.
🤖 Yes, sure
🧑 Go to life and send me some life related news
🤖 Here are some life related news that I found:
        1.Ask the doctor: I go to bed early, eat well and exercise – so why am I always exhausted by lunchtime?
        2.Ever-decreasing spaces, yet we continue to make bigger cars
🧑 Open second one and Summarize the first three paragraphs in a few words
🤖 Here is the summary that I found using ChatGPT:
        New car launches typically introduce larger vehicles than their predecessors, except for a few exceptions like the Opel Astra. Larger cars give the perception of getting more value for money, but they also come with a higher price tag.
🧑 That’s all for now.
🤖 Alright.

What I extracted from this for my dataset is:

Goal: "Summarize the second news article in the Life section of the Irish Independent."

Steps: 
1. Navigate to the Life section.
2. Open the second article.
3. Read and summarize the content.
4. Provide the summarized output to the user

🧑 Hi
🤖 Hello
🧑 Please open the Investopedia website.
🤖 Sure.
🧑 Search "Trading for Beginners."
🧑 Show me some articles
🤖 Here are the options:
        1.10 Day Trading Tips for Beginners
        2.7 Best ETF Trading Strategies for Beginners
        3.Options Trading for Beginners
🧑 Open the first one.
🧑 Open the second section and send me the first paragraph.
🤖 Assess and commit to the amount of capital you're willing to risk on each trade. Many successful day traders risk less than 1% to 2% of their accounts per trade. If you have a $40,000 trading account and are willing to risk 0.5% of your capital on each trade, your maximum loss per trade is $200 (0.5% x $40,000).
🧑 We can conclude here.
🤖 Sure.

What is extracted:

Goal: "Retrieve the first paragraph of the second section of the first article related to ’Trading for beginners’ on Investopedia."

Steps: 
1. Search for articles on ”Trading for beginners.”
2. Review the first three articles.
3. Open the first article.
4. Retrieve first paragraph of section number 2.

If you noticed the step of opening the website is ignored, this is because we are assuming the expected page is already open. 

DO NOT mention the page name or URL on the steps, as examples show.

Is expected that in your plan you don't inlude any specific information since you are only forseeing the steps required while not actually accesing any web pages. 
While your goal has to include all information relevant for the steps.
