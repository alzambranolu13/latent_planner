ðŸ§‘ Hello
ðŸ¤– Hi
ðŸ§‘ Please open Plos Biology and show me some of the recently published articles in Plos one.
ðŸ¤– Sure
ðŸ¤– Here is the list:
	1. Development of an amplicon-based sequencing approach in response to the global emergence of mpox
	2. Ring neurons in the Drosophila central complex act as a rheostat for sensory modulation of aging
	3. Learning science alongside peers with intellectual and developmental disabilities
ðŸ§‘ Open the second one.
ðŸ¤– Sure
ðŸ§‘ Please provide me with the summary of the introduction.
ðŸ¤– Okay
ðŸ¤– Below summary has been generated using Bard AI:
	
	The perception of dead conspecifics in Drosophila melanogaster can have a significant impact on the lifespan and physiology of the flies.
	This effect is mediated by a small subset of 5-HT2A-expressing neurons in the ellipsoid body (EB), which are required for the lifespan effects caused by death exposure.
	The transcription factor associated with insulin-signaling, foxo, is required in these neurons.
	The Drosophila insulin-like peptides (dilp) 3 and 5, but not dilp2, were also required to mediate lifespan effects due to death perception.
	These findings may provide insight for treating individuals who are routinely exposed to stressful situations surrounding death.
ðŸ§‘ Okay, thanks for the information.
ðŸ¤– Not a problem. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need any further assistance.
